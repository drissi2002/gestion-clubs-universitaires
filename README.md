# UniversityClubManagement

Our project, titled CLUBâ€™Y, is a desktop application developed in Java designed to manage clubs and their members. It also includes a mechanism for generating membership cards .

For the implementation, we used: IntelliJ, Java 8, JavaFX, phpMyAdmin, and Figma (for prototyping).
